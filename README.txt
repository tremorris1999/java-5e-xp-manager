Fifth Edition XP Manager version 1.0.0

This is available to anyone at the low price of free-ninety-free.
I put way more work into this than I probably should have, but here we are.

Anyway, this is my first project attempting to utilize the javax.swing library and I
had a ton of (mostly) fun making it. This one goes out to all my fellow lazy POS
DMs. One less math to do constantly.


Tips:
	- In the generated folder 'default/output' exists a file output.data, rename this
	file and store close by so you can have an output file for every group you may run.
	Just use the built-in File > Open and pick the .data file for the group/game.

	- To add XP to multiple characters, hold CTRL when selecting from the list.

	- If you really care, all files generated by this application are in fact
	unencrypted. Feel free to change the extension back to '.txt' to look at the files
	involved. It's also my first time using file IO that carries over each run.


Thanks everyone. Enjoy!
